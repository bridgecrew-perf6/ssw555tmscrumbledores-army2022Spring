# scrumbledores-army

This is a project by an agile team scrumbledores-army to create a game for mental health that enables employees in high-stress working environments to draw or scribble away to images that they can choose from the game repository or upload themselves in order feel relaxed and reduce their stress levels, while listening to calming music.
